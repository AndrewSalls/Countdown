## Summary
This program recreates the "well known" (in the 80s) game Countdown's number round.
In summary: Contestants are given a list of numbers, and a target number. Their objective is to get as close as possible to the target number, using only the list of numbers and a few simple operations (+, -, *, /).

## Changes/Improvements
This recreation mimics the original (including additional details such as restrictions on how the list of numbers is generated), while adding additional functionality to make the game less of a game show and more of a mathematical competition.
- Firstly, the target number is always reachable exactly using just the provided numbers and operations, and there is a tool to see how that target is reached.

- Secondly, the host can choose to show or hide the numbers.

- Third, in the original game, numbers are always random from two categories "big" numbers, and "small" numbers. These categories still exist, but what numbers are in each category, and how many numbers to choose from each, can be customized.
- Fourth, contestants can enter their solution to see if they are right/how far away they are from the target (not fully working yet)
- Finally, numbers and operations can be replaced with any arbitrary "number" and "operation" (in the mathematical sense). For example, you could replace numbers with matrices and the operations with matrix operations, or replace numbers with letters and the operations with cryptograms.
